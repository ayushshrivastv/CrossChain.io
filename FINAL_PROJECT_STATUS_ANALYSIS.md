## ⚠️ **REMAINING SECURITY VULNERABILITIES**

### **Solana Program Vulnerabilities (3 Critical + 6 Warnings)**

#### **🔴 Critical Vulnerabilities (3)**
1. **ring v0.16.20** - Unmaintained cryptographic library
   - **Impact**: Potential security issues in cryptographic operations
   - **Solution**: Update to ring v0.17+ when available in ecosystem
   - **Risk Level**: Medium (library used by Solana SDK, not directly by our code)

2. **borsh v0.9.3** - Unsound parsing with ZST types
   - **Impact**: Potential memory safety issues
   - **Solution**: Update to borsh v0.10+ (already in our dependencies)
   - **Risk Level**: Low (affects only specific edge cases)

3. **ouroboros v0.15.6** - Unsound memory management
   - **Impact**: Memory safety issues in self-referential structs
   - **Solution**: Used by Solana runtime, not directly by our code
   - **Risk Level**: Low (dependency of Solana SDK)

#### **🟡 Warnings (6)**
- **derivative v2.2.0** - Unmaintained (used by ark-crypto)
- **paste v1.0.15** - No longer maintained (used by ark-crypto)
- **proc-macro-error v1.0.4** - Unmaintained (used by ouroboros)
- **atty v0.2.14** - Potential unaligned read
- **Multiple clap versions** - Version conflicts
- **Configuration warnings** - 20 Anchor cfg warnings (harmless)

### **Risk Assessment**
- **Most vulnerabilities are in transitive dependencies** (Solana SDK, crypto libraries)
- **None directly affect our lending pool logic**
- **Acceptable for testnet deployment**
- **Should be monitored for ecosystem updates**
